# frozen_string_literal: false

# Evaluate the following
# (32 * 4) >= 129 # false, because 128 is not greater than or equal to 129.
# false != !true # false, because !true is false, and it's false to write false does not equal false.
# true == 4 # false, because different value types cannot be equal.
# false == (847 == '874') # true, because false == false.
# (!true || (!(100 / 5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false # true, because there's at least one true statement
#   amongst several or statements.
