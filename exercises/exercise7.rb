# Q. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

# A. Arrays are organized by ordered index; hashes are organized by key, which is an associative data structure.
#    Before Ruby v1.9, hashes were not ordered (programmers could not expect a specific order when iterating).
#      Starting with v1.9, hash items (key-value pairs) have a consistent order.
